# Pixel Art Maker Project

The job was to build a single-page web app that allows users to draw pixel art on a customizable canvas.

## Tasks performed to achieve this project

- The users are able to:
    - Dynamically set the size of the table as an _N_ by _M_ grid
    - Choose a color
    - Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color

## Extra task

- I created a function that enables the users to randomily generate a full-colored grid
